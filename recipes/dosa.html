    <h1>This is Wheat Dosa recipe. from south India</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      While it's true a perfectly made, expertly fried, and quickly served
      samosa is superior to this version, that can be a very rare combination of
      events. By comparison, this quesadilla approach is almost impossible to
      mess up, and if you use enough oil in your pan, you should be able to
      achieve a beautifully browned, crispy crust that rivals something out of a
      deep fryer.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch baking soda</li>
      <li>1 ¾ cups water, or more as needed</li>
      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

          Combine flour, 2 tablespoons oil, salt, and baking soda together in a
          bowl. Mix for 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 3/4 cup water and mix until it's
          lump free, the chunks of flour have dissolved, and the batter has a
          good consistency, adding more water if needed.

          Heat 1 tablespoon oil on a griddle over medium heat. Pour some of the
          batter onto the griddle; spread the batter in a circular motion,
          slowly yet steadily. Cook until the edges start to brown, 2 to 3
          minutes. Remove from the grill. Repeat with remaining batter, adding
          more oil between each batch.

          The trick in this recipe is the batter, you want to make sure to have
          it to the consistency of a regular dosa batter. (If you don't know
          what that means, it's almost the same consistency as yogurt.) You can
          use 1 tablespoon butter instead of 2 tablespoons oil. The butter/oil
          added initially to the dosa batter ensures the crispiness. You can use
          baking powder instead of baking soda. It's important to make sure you
          add just a pinch of baking powder or soda. I'd recommend the soda
          since it has a slightly bitter flavor that's commonly seen.
