    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups flour</li>
      <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 36 muffin cups
          with paper cups. Whisk together flour, white sugar, cocoa, baking
          soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, oil, water, and
          vanilla extract. Mix with an electric mixer at low speed until smooth,
          about 2 minutes. Fill prepared muffin cups a little over half full
          (use a #20 or 3-tablespoon scoop).
        </p>

          Bake until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, 18 to 22
          minutes. Transfer from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
        </p>

          Meanwhile, for the filling, combine powdered sugar, butter,
          shortening, milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch salt in another large
          bowl. Using clean beaters, mix with an electric mixer at high speed
          until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Insert a large round tip into a pastry
          bag; fill with filling. Push tip through top of each cooled cupcake to
          fill; wipe excess frosting off to create a smooth top.
        </p>

          Frost tops with chocolate frosting. Insert a small round tip into a
          clean pastry bag; fill with vanilla frosting. Pipe frosting across
          tops of cupcakes in loops. Transfer cupcakes to an airtight container.
          Store at room temperature up to 3 days or freeze up to 3 months.
