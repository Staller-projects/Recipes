    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      While it's true a perfectly made, expertly fried, and quickly served
      samosa is superior to this version, that can be a very rare combination of
      events. By comparison, this quesadilla approach is almost impossible to
      mess up, and if you use enough oil in your pan, you should be able to
      achieve a beautifully browned, crispy crust that rivals something out of a
      deep fryer.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Â½ pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled</li>
      <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>And many more...</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <p>
          Cut potatoes into 1/4-inch cubes. Transfer into a pot of cold water.
          Stir in salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Simmer over medium
          heat until cubes are tender but still hold their shape, about 15
          minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and set aside. Heat olive oil
          and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion. Cook and stir
          until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1
          teaspoon kosher salt, garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and
          cayenne in a small bowl for the spice mix.

          Add serrano pepper, garlic, ginger, and the spice mix to the onions.
          Cook and stir until mixture is well combined, about 2 minutes. Add
          peas; cook until heated through and slightly tender, about 3 minutes.
          Transfer mixture into a bowl with the potatoes. Add cilantro and lemon
          juice. Mix with a spatula until filling is well combined, with some
          potatoes partially mashed. Add more salt if needed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Combine cilantro, mint, green onions, serrano pepper, lime juice, and
          yogurt in a blender. Blend until smooth. Season with salt. Spread a
          few spoonfuls of the filling over one half of 1 tortilla. Fold in
          half. Repeat with remaining filling and tortillas.

          Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook each quesadilla until
          browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer quesadilla onto
          your work surface and cut in thirds. Plate and serve at any
          temperature, alongside the chutney sauce.
